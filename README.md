# Write Something Nice

Ever felt like making someone's day with a small act of kindness?
Inspired by the game [Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070710/Kind_Words_lo_fi_chill_beats_to_write_to/), this app is a simple platform where people can anonymously vent about rough things going on in their lives and getting nice replies back. Kind behaviour will be incentivized by gamifying the reply process with stats and thumbs up to let the responder know that the original poster loved what they wrote. Maybe this will become a den for trolls but there's a lack of free, approachable places to have an anonymous support group on the mobile market.

## Features

- The ability to write fully anonymous letters that will only be visible to one good samaritan who volunteers to reply to a letter.
- The ability to reply to a random anonymous letter that hasn't been replied yet.
- Report feature for troll or mean letters or replies.
- User accounts with stats and achievements to gamify the experience.
- Leaderboards for our top responders.

## Progress
